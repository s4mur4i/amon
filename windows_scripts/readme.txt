Use Skeleton.ps1 to start writing new scripts
Create small building blocks
Naming convention for scripts should be: <Verb>-LMI<Noun>.ps1
	Included LMI string after dash sign to avoid any name collision (3rd party stuff on the machine, AWS script naming, etc) ---> useful for writing advanced functions
